Abstract. In this article a novel approach to fuzzy hierarchical clustering of short text fragments is presented. Nowadays dataset which contains a large and even huge amount of short text fragments becomes quite a common object. Different kinds of short messages, article or news headers are examples of this kind of objects. 
Authors have taken another similar object which is dataset of key process indi-cators of Strategic Planning System of Russian Federation. 
In order to reveal structure and thematic variety fuzzy clustering approach is proposed. Hierarchy as a result of clustering is desirable because of large dataset. And fuzzy graph as a model has been chosen as the most natural view of connected set of words.
